# Hardware implementation on tofino

## Run

- In switchos
	+ `bash compile.sh`
	+ `bash start_switch.sh`
	+ `bash configure.sh`
- Test correctness
	+ In receiver server
		* `sudo python3 receiver.py`
	+ In sender server
		* `sudo python3 sender.py`
- Hardware resource usagae
	+ Check visualization files generated by Tofino

## NOTE

- C1 ~ C4 represent four families of in-band network telemetry
- original_INT represents original in-band network telemetry, which is adjusted from basic_switch (standard P4 program provided by Tofino)
