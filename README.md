# HPCC-PINT simulation
This is the simulator for HPCC-PINT, an advanced version of HPCC with one byte overhead per packet, introduced in PINT: Probabilistic In-band Network Telemetry (SIGCOMM' 2020).

## NS-3 simulation
The ns-3 simulation is under `simulation/`. Refer to the README.md under it for more details.

## Traffic generator
The traffic generator is under `traffic_gen/`. Refer to the README.md under it for more details.

## Analysis
We provide a few analysis scripts under `analysis/` to view the packet-level events, and analyzing the fct in the same way as [PINT](https://liyuliang001.github.io/publications/pint.pdf) Figure 7 and 8.
Refer to the README.md under it for more details.
