# Analysis
This folder includes code and scripts for analysis.

## FCT analysis
`fct_analysis.py` is used to analyze fct. It reads multiple fct files (simulation's output), and prints data that can produce figures like Figure 11 (a) and (c) in [HPCC paper](https://liyuliang001.github.io/publications/hpcc.pdf).

## Trace reader
`trace_reader` is used to parse the .tr files output by the simulation.
